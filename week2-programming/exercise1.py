# Last week you wrote a program that printed out a cheery greeting including your
# name. Take a copy of it, and modify it so that the user enters their name at the
# keyboard, and then receives a greeting. For example:
# Hello, what is your name? Mr Apricot
# Hello, Mr Apricot. Good to meet you!

name = input('Hello, What is your name? ')
print(f"Hello, {name}. Good to meet you!")
